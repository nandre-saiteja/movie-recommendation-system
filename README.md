MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

Overview : 

This project is a movie recommender system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. The system uses vectorization techniques to convert movie metadata into numerical vectors, which are then used to compute similarities between movies and make recommendations.

Features :

Movie Metadata Processing: The system processes movie metadata, including title, genres, and plot descriptions.

Vectorization: The metadata is converted into numerical vectors using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

Similarity Calculation: The cosine similarity metric is used to compute the similarity between movie vectors.

Recommendations: Based on the similarity scores, the system recommends movies that are similar to a given movie.

Technologies Used : 

Python: The primary programming language used for the implementation.

Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: Provides tools for vectorization and similarity calculation.

Numpy: Used for numerical operations.
